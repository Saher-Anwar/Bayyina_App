    Build a corpus database from a text file containing corpus data.

    This function reads a text file specified by file_path, where each line
    contains a corpus data for each word. It retrieves the lines, parses it

    the SQL table.

    Parameters:
    file_path (str): The path to the text file containing corpus data.
